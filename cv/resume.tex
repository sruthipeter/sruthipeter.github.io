\item
    \ressubheading{Undergraduate Thesis}{Prague, CZ}{Advisor: Prof. Judith Gerardi, SUNY Empire State College}{2015}
      \begin{itemize}
            \item{The primary research question explored whether the presence of female significant figures (eg.  female siblings) influences the power/ dominance Indian men have on their partners in romantic relationships (RR).}
            \item{The main hypothesis of the study was supported in that a higher number of female siblings enforces gender stereotypes in Indian men. Indian men with higher number of female siblings believed in higher decision power in RR. Pearson's coefficient r- value was 0.5 for the correlation between number of female siblings and decision making power index (p<0.05).}
