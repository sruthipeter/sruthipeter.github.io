		I was born in the beautiful city of [Trivandrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram) in India. I lived there for 18 years of my life before moving to [Prague, Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague) to pursue my undergraduate studies. I went to [Charles University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University) to study medicine. By the end of my first year, I realized that my passion lies not in the anatomy and physiology of people but in understanding our social behavior. After doing some research, I was convinced that I’m actually interested in Psychology. Soon after, I moved to the [University of New York in Prague (UNYP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_York_in_Prague) , from where I graduated with a major in Psychology. 
		
		> Talking about Prague...
		
		I attach a lot of sentiments to that city. In fact, I believe that say Prague was my window to the world (literally!). I had lived with my parents all through my life while in India. As a young teenager living alone in Prague, it was quite an interesting ride I must say! The experiences there taught me the baby steps into a mature adult life. I learned to take care of myself and do all duties and responsibilities by myself. I also learned some basic Czech that was not necessary but that did ease life from time to time. I can safely say that the young teen was transformed into a responsible adult in no time. 
		
		I love Prague for countless reasons! The rich and heritage history of the city can be seen in the form of a myriad architectural structures found throughout the city. One can witness the 14th century Gothic cathedrals and the 18th century Baroque churches located adjacent to the 21st century modern buildings in harmony. Moving from a tropical city with two seasons (dry season and monsoon season), I absolutely enjoyed the change of seasons in Prague! We did have all four seasons in its full swing every year! I also got the amazing opportunity to travel around a bit in Europe during my stay in Prague. I visited countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, Italy, that I’ve dreamt of visiting one day since I was 10 or so. Traveling as a student was not easy but that didn’t stop me from doing it solely because of the happiness and satisfaction it brought me.
