		I was born in the beautiful city of <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram"> Trivandrum </a> in India. I lived there for 18 years of my life before moving to <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague"> Prague, Czech Republic </a> to pursue my undergraduate studies. I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University"> Charles University </a> to study medicine. By the end of my first year, I realized that my passion lies not in the anatomy and physiology of people but in understanding our social behavior. After doing some research, I was convinced that Iâ€™m actually interested in Psychology. Soon after, I moved to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_York_in_Prague"> University of New York in Prague </a> , from where I graduated with a major in Psychology.

	<em> Talking about Prague...</em>
	
</p>

<p>
		
	I attach a lot of sentiments to that city. As a young teenager living alone in Prague, it was quite an interesting ride I must say! The experiences there taught me the baby steps into a mature adult life. I also learned some basic Czech that was not necessary but that did ease life from time to time. I can safely say that the young teen was transformed into a responsible adult in no time.

	Prague is a breathtakingly beautiful city! The rich and heritage history of the city can be seen in the form of a myriad architectural structures found throughout the city. One can witness the 14th century Gothic cathedrals and the 18th century Baroque churches located adjacent to the 21st century modern buildings in harmony. <br>
