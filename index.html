	<h1>Sruthi Peter</h1>
	<p>I am currently a research assistant with <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/sibl/">Stereotypes, Identiy and Belonging Lab (SIBL)</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. Previously, I majored in Psychology from a joint degree program between <a href="https://www.esc.edu"> SUNY Empire State College </a> and <a href="https://www.unyp.cz/"> University of New York in Prague </a>. 

	<br> <br> I am particularly interested in Social Psychology.
