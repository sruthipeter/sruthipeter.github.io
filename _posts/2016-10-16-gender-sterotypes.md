I am currently putting together the code I used for my major thesis. This will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sruthipeter/gender-stereotypes). Since most of the code was in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), I have decided to explore the use of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to make it easy for anybody to reproduce the statistical analysis conducted as part of my major thesis. The motivation is that Github offers [excellent support](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3) for these notebooks, so that makes it easy to host them here. Plus, I get to learn notebooks!

Over the coming days, I will add a brief writeup about the thesis here as well.
