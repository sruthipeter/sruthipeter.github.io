I am currently putting together the code I used for my major thesis. This will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sruthipeter/gender-stereotypes). Since most of the code was in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), I have decided to explore the use of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to make it easy for anybody to reproduce the statistical analysis conducted as part of my major thesis. The motivation is that Github offers [excellent support](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3) for these notebooks, so that makes it easy to host them here. Plus, I get to learn notebooks

You can checkout the [Notebook](https://github.com/sruthipeter/gender-stereotypes/blob/master/gender-stereotypes.ipynb) now. Github makes it very easy to share research material in this way!

**_The study explored whether the presence of female significant figures (eg. female siblings) influences the power/ dominance Indian men have on their partner in romantic relationships `RR`._**

>According to Wetizman's Role Theory (1979), children develop their behaviors and attitudes on thr basis of the presence of significant figures in their life. 

### **_Participants_** 

* All participants were over 18 years of age.   
* Indian men either currently in a relationship (married or unmarried) or had previously been in a relationship.  
* 51 responses were recorded. 3 participants were discarded due to their failure to complete the full survey. 48 participants were studied.  

### **_Instruments_** 

* Self- perceived Deciosion Making Power Questionnaire (Blood and Wolf, 1960)  
* The Index of Marital Satisfaction (IMS)  
* Sociodemographic details  

### **_Results_**

* The main hypothesis of the study was supported in that higher number of female siblings enforce gender stereotypes in Indian men.
* Indian men with higher number of female siblings believed in higher decision power in RR. 
* Pearson's coefficient r- value was 0.5 for the correlation between number of female siblings and decision making power index (p<0.05).
